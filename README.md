## Sentiment Analysis ## 
An advanced sentiment analysis application that combines machine learning with emotional text analysis to provide accurate sentiment predictions and rating estimations for laptop reviews.

ðŸŽ¯ Purpose

This project addresses the common challenge of understanding true customer sentiment from product reviews. Traditional sentiment analysis often falls short when reviewers give conflicting signals - for example, writing negatively while giving a high rating, or vice versa. Our enhanced approach combines multiple data sources to provide more nuanced and accurate sentiment analysis.
